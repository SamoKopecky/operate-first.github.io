In many cases, initiating via GitOps is the only way to accomplish something.\n        </Text>\n        <Text>\n          If you have any further questions, you can reach to [Op1st community support](https://www.operate-first.cloud/community-handbook/support/README.md) for help.\n        </Text>\n        <Text>\n          Learning Resources\n          As the Op1st project adds training and other learning resources, those will be linked in here to help open source developers find a learning pathway or self-directed learning within these materials.\n        </Text>\n        <Text>\n          The GitOps Reference Documentation is useful for finding the what and how of getting operations done in the project.\n          Beginning in January 2022 the project is rolling out SRE training courses, which will incorporate meaningful examples from the running Op1st community cloud.\n        </Text>\n        <Text>\n          Source: https://www.operate-first.cloud/open-source-developers/\n        </Text>\n\n      </Container>\n      <Footer/>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default DeveloperPage;\n"],"names":["jsx","global","order","my"],"sourceRoot":""}
